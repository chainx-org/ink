//! Contract environments.
//!
//! A contract is able to operate on different environments.
//!
//! Currently the SRML environment operating directly on the
//! substrate runtime module library (SRML) and the test
//! environment for testing and inspecting contracts are
//! provided.
//!
//! By default the SRML environment is used.
//! To enable the test environment the `test-env` crate feature
//! has to be enabled.
